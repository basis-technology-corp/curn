CHANGELOG: curn (Customizable Utilitarian RSS Notifier)

Copyright (c) 2004-2010 Brian M. Clapper. All rights reserved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.2.9 (24 June, 2012)

- Changes to Maven repositories, to get FreeMarker to resolve again.
- Minor changes to the way the installer is generated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2.8 (18 September, 2011)

- Now builds with Buildr and uses Maven semantics for third-party
  dependencies.
- Now uses javax.script directly. Support for the Bean Scripting Framework
  (BSF) is gone. The "ScriptAPI" configuration parameter is also gone.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2.7 (13 September, 2010)

- Implemented a new PruneOriginalRSSPlugIn plug-in that saves a copy of the
  original RSS document after removing any already-seen items. This plug-in
  is conceptually similar to the SaveAsRSSPlugIn, except that
  PruneOriginalRSSPlugIn works directly off a JDOM version of the RSS
  document (i.e., at the XML level), which means it's less likely to drop
  non-standard XML elements from the RSS feed, since the edited DOM does
  not go through the ROME parser.

  NOTE: This plug-in was funded by Dow Jones & Co., under contract with
  ArdenTex, Inc.  Dow Jones & Co. and ArdenTex, Inc. have donated the
  resulting code back to the Curn project, as open source.

- Updated the ROME RSS parser adapter to parse the RSS document via a
  JDOM object, rather than a file. This change allows the Curn RSS parser
  API to provide a JDOM view of the feed, as well as the ROME version.

- Removed spurious informa.jar from the distribution. Curn no longer bundles
  the Informa RSS parsing API; the jar was a leftover.

- Updated RSSChannel class to provide an enumerated value that indicates
  the type of the RSS feed.

- Installer no longer pre-selects source and documentation packs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2.6 (23 April, 2010)

- Rolled in new version of org.clapper Java Utility library, which contains
  a fix for boolean configuration value parsing. This new library fixes bugs
  with Curn's handling of boolean configuration values, which were defaulting
  to "false" in cases where they should not have been.
- Changed license to a true BSD license.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2.5 (26 February, 2010)

- Freemarker transformation code is a little more careful: It no longer
  invokes Freemarker on a template, if there are no feeds to display.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2.4 (25 October, 2009)

- Fixed null pointer exception when RetainArticlesPlugIn refers to an item
  that has no URL.
- Fixed null pointer exception when saving the cache for an item that has
  no URL.
- Curn now supports a -e (--config-encoding) parameter, to specify the encoding
  of the configuration file. If not specified, the encoding defaults to the
  JVM's default encoding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2.3 (12 April, 2009)

				 ---------
				 Bug Fixes
				 ---------

- Added new PostFeedProcessPlugIn phase, and changed most existing plug-ins
  to use it. This reflects what's really happening: The plug-in is being
  invoked after the feed is parsed *and* after it's been processed.

- Left RetainArticlesPlugIn as a PostFeedParsePlugIn. This corrects a bug
  introduced in version 3.2.2: That fix to PostFeedParsePlugIn broken the
  ShowArticlesFor configuration keyword.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2.2 (8 January, 2009)

				 ---------
				 Bug Fixes
				 ---------

- Fixed a bug introduced during curn 3.2: curn was invoking each
  PostFeedParsePlugIn class with a parsed feed before determining whether
  items in the feed were new or not. It should have been invoking the
  plug-ins after determining whether items were new or not. This error,
  introduced in curn 3.2, affected the following plug-ins:

  * MaxArticlesPlugIn
  * RetainArticlesPlugIn
  * SaveAsRSSPlugIn

  There are other plug-ins that implement the PostFeedParsePlugIn
  interface, but the bug would not have affected them.

- Updated to Javamail 1.4.1 and JAF 1.1.1.

			       ------------
			       Enhancements
			       ------------


- The EmailOutputPlugIn now supports an optional SMTPLocalhost parameter for
  identifying the local host.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2.1 (11 September, 2007)


				 ---------
				 Bug Fixes
				 ---------

- Fixed a bug in the ParsedFeedURLEdit plug-in (which supports the
  EditItemURL and EditFeedURL configuration items). The plug-in properly
  performed the edit, but the changed URL didn't get back into the
  item/feed.

- The RSS parser logic now properly handles empty, but present, links
  (URL references) in the RSS feed. Prior to this fix, curn handled
  missing link elements just fine; however, if the link element was present,
  but empty, curn puked on the feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.2 (29 August, 2007)

			       ------------
			       Enhancements
			       ------------

- Refinements to the installer to support non-English installations better.
  For instance, the installer should now suggest the appropriate program
  files directory on Windows (e.g., "C:\Programme" for a German
  installation), instead of always using "C:\Program Files". Thanks to
  Carsten Kr�ger (C.Krueger /at/ gmx /dot/ org) for pointing out the
  problem and testing the fix.

- Minor refinements to the use of concurrent download threads.

- Added new ${escapeHTML} method to FreeMarker data model, allowing
  FreeMarker templates to escape special HTML/XML characters such as "&".

- Added a new "SaveAsRSS" plug-in. This plug-in operates on a parsed
  feed and converts the new data in a feed to a specified RSS format,
  then saves it. The new plug-in works on a per-feed basis. For instance:

        [Feed_foobar]
        URL: http://www.example.com/rss/fooblog/
        ReplaceEmptySummaryWith: nothing
        ShowAuthors:    true
        AllowEmbeddedHTML: true
        SaveAsRSS: --type rss1 --encoding utf-8 ${curn:curnDir}/tst-rss1-dup.xml

   The plug-in can convert to RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 or Atom format. The plug-in
   works on parsed feed data, which means that it only sees new items
   (because curn's parsing logic discards old items). Thus, if there's no
   new data, the plug-in isn't invoked, and it doesn't generate the output.

   The plug-in can save backup copies of the generated RSS files (i.e.,
   it can save versions of the generated RSS files from previous runs);
   this is configured via a "--backup" option to the "SaveAsRSS" value.
   
   See the "SaveAsRSS" parameter in the User's Guide for details.

- Added a new "IgnoreOldArticles" plug-in. This plug-in provides a way to
  ignore articles that are older than a certain interval. Intervals are
  expressed in a natural language syntax. For instance:

       IgnoreArticlesOlderThan: 3 days
       IgnoreArticlesOlderThan: 1 week
       IgnoreArticlesOlderThan: 365 days
       IgnoreArticlesOlderThan: 12 hours, 30 minutes

  Valid interval names (in English) are:

        millisecond, milliseconds, ms
        second, seconds, sec, secs
        minute, minutes, min, mins
        hour, hours, hr, hrs
        day, days
        week, weeks

  If you're running curn in a Spanish or French locale, the appropriate
  Spanish or French equivalents are also available, as well as the English
  versions. (Supporting additional locales requires modifying the
  org.clapper.util library, but it's easy enough to do.)

  "year" and "month" are not supported, to avoid the irregularity of leaps
  years and different month lengths, respectively.

  See the User's Guide for details.

- Added a new "MaxArticles" plug-in. This plug-in provides a way to limit
  the number of articles displayed for each feed. It can be configured
  globally and per feed. See the User's Guide for details.

- Added a new "RetainArticles" plug-in. This plug-in provides a
  configuration parameter, "ShowArticlesFor", that allows you to specify
  that articles are to be shown more than once. It takes a time interval
  like the "IgnoreArticlesOlderThan" parameter. For instance:

        ShowArticlesFor: 2 days

  See the User's Guide for details.

- Added a new "MailIndividualArticles" parameter (implemented by the
  existing EmailOutputPlugIn). If emailing is enabled and this parameter is
  set to "true", curn will email each new article in its own, individual
  message. Thus, if there are 200 new articles in all of the feeds, curn
  will send 200 email messages, each with a single article. If emailing
  is enabled and this parameter is "false" or missing, curn will do what
  it's always done, namely, send a single email message containing all
  output.

- Within a given plug-in phase, all plug-ins implementing that phase now
  execute in sorted order. That is, they're sorted per-phase by their
  declared sort keys, and they executed in that order.

- Minor change to FreeMarker templates for HTML and summary output so that
  they display "1 item" instead of "1 items" when appropriate.


				  -------
				  Changes
				  -------

- The PostFeedParsePlugIn interface's runPostFeedParsePlugIn() method
  now takes a third parameter: The FeedCache.

- The OutputHandler interface now requires a makeCopy() method. Existing
  output handlers must be extended to support that method.

- Modified the per-feed "SaveAs" configuration parameter to use a command
  line-style argument. The output encoding is now specified with a
  "--encoding" option to the parameter's value. The parameter also supports
  a new "--backup" option that can be used to save previously downloaded
  raw feed data.

  See the "SaveAs" parameter in the User's Guide for details.

- Deprecated the per-feed "SaveOnly" configuration parmeater, in favor of
  the new "--encoding" option to "SaveAs". "SaveOnly" will still be
  honored, but its usage will generate a warning.

- Updated bundled freemarker.jar from version 2.3.6 to version 2.3.10.
  See http://freemarker.org/

- Updated bundled rome.jar from version 0.8 to version 0.9.
  See https://rome.dev.java.net/

- Moved FreeMarker transformation logic to new FreeMarkerFeedTransformer
  class, and modified FreeMarkerOutputHandler to use that class. The
  new transformer class can now be used by plug-ins.

- Removed an optimization: Previously, if there were no configured output
  handlers, curn would download the feed each feed only if "SaveAs" were
  specified for the feed. Further, since there were no output handlers,
  curn would not bother parsing the feed. With the introduction of
  plug-ins, however, that behavior is broken. A plug-in that relies on
  parsed data (such as the SaveAsRSS plug-in) should still work even if
  there are no output handlers. So, curn now parses the downloaded RSS
  feeds even if there are no output handlers configured.

- Removed support for Informa RSS parser. ROME is better maintained and
  more functional, and I don't see the point to maintaining both. I was
  only maintaining Informa to illustrate that it was possible to support
  more than one RSS parser in curn.

				 ---------
				 Bug Fixes
				 ---------

- Fixed the ROME RSSChannelAdapter to return the items in a LinkedHashSet,
  not a HashSet, to preserve the original sort order (i.e., the order of
  items in the XML) if the SortBy parameter is not set or is set to "none".

- Fixed a null pointer exception that could occur if all items in a channel
  have been suppressed by a plug-in.

- Fixed a bug in HTTP character set interpretation. Most HTTP servers that
  specify a character do so with a Content-Type: header that looks like
  this:

	Content-Type: text/xml; charset=ISO-8859-1
	Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8
	etc.

  However, some (e.g., Microsoft IIS/5.0) emit:

	Content-Type: text/xml; Charset=ISO-8859-1

  curn was only honoring lower-case in the "charset" field, leading it to
  ignore advertised character sets.

- Fixed a ROME parser usage error. curn was assuming that ROME would set
  the "authors" field in its SyndFeed and SyndEntry classes, even for feed
  types (like RSS 2.0) that only support a single author. However, ROME
  appears to keep two separate fields:

  * an "authors" field for feeds (like Atom) that support multiple authors
    per item
  * an "author" field for feeds (like RSS 2.0) that support only one author
    per item

  curn only ever looked at the "authors" field, so it wasn't propagated
  the author for RSS 2.0 fields. This bug is now fixed.

- Fixed a bug in the RSS parser: RSSItem.getFirstContentType() was always
  returning null, because its internal content map wasn't being set. This
  problem affected two plug-ins, as well as use of the API. Thanks to
  Scott White (scottblanc /at/ gmail /dot/ com) for reporting the problem.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.1 (29 November, 2006)

			       ------------
			       Enhancements
			       ------------

- curn's multithreaded download logic now uses the java.util.concurrent
  library, instead of native Java synchronization. While this change won't
  necessarily improve performance for small numbers of feeds and threads,
  it should permit curn to scale better to large numbers of feeds. Improving
  concurrency and performance is an ongoing effort; expect more changes in
  this area in subsequent releases.

- The configuration file parser now supports "${var?default value}" syntax.
  In that example, if "${var}" does not have a value, or has an empty
  value, the string "default value" will be substituted.

- The configuration file specified on the curn command line can now be
  a path or a URL. (Previously, curn only accepted a path.)

- curn's ScriptOutputHandler now supports both the Apache Jakarta Bean
  Scripting Framework and the Java 6 (JSR 223) javax.script scripting
  framework. The Java 6 scripting framework requires Java 6, obviously.
  By default, the ScriptOutputHandler first tries to use the javax.script
  infrastructure; if that doesn't work, it tries to the BSF infrastructure.
  You can force it to try just one of them with the (new) optional
  "ScriptingAPI" configuration directive. That directive takes two possible
  values:

           javax.script - use the Java 6 scripting framework, and abort
                          if it's not available
           bsf          - use the Bean Scripting Framework, and abort if
                          it's not available

  e.g.:

          [OutputHandlerMyScript]
          Class: org.clapper.curn.output.script.ScriptOutputHandler
          Script: ${system:user.home}/curn/my_output_handler.py
          Language: jython
          ScriptingAPI: bsf

  Notes:

  a) The Bean Scripting Framework API is shipped with curn. If you use
     the curn.bat or curn.sh script installed by the curn graphical
     installer, you will automatically have access to the BSF API and
     the language bindings that are shipped with it.

  b) To use the Java 6 javax.script API, you must be running under Java 6.
     Additionally, to use any languages other than Rhino Javascript (which
     comes with Java 6), you must have the add-on JSR 223 scripting engine
     jar file for the scripting language you're using. JSR 223 scripting
     engines are available  "https://scripting.dev.java.net/".

- The FreeMarkerOutputHandler (org.clapper.curn.output.freemarker package)
  now exports a "configuredURL" value for each channel, in addition to the
  existing "url" parameter. "url" contains the channel's URL, as published
  in the downloaded feed XML; "configuredURL" contains the URL as listed
  in the curn configuration file. The two URLs might be the same, but they
  can also be different (due to HTTP redirects, etc.).

				  -------
				  Changes
				  -------

- The org.clapper.curn.CurnConfig class no longer provides constructors
  that parse the configuration; Such constructors are unsafe, since they
  invoke methods in the parent class that, in turn, call methods that could
  be overridden--and thus could be called on an incompletely constructed
  object. CurnConfig now provides explicit load() methods, instead.

- By default, curn now aborts if it encounters a reference to an undefined
  configuration file variable. Previously, it would simply substitute an
  empty string, but that behavior can lead to some hard-to-debug runtime
  errors. A new -U (--allow-undefined-cfg-vars) command-line option
  restores the original behavior.

- The ScriptOutputHandler no longer supports the BSF objects that had
  to be retrieved via "bsf.lookupBean()". Instead, only the global
  "curn" object is exposed, and it's exposed automatically as a script
  global. For more information, see the "Writing a Script Output Handler"
  section in the "curn User's Guide".

- The Common XML Fixups plug-in:

  a) now does "demoronization" (with apologies to John Walker's
     "demoroniser" tool). Demoronizing is the act of replacing Microsoft
     Windows-specific characters with more reasonable, universal
     values--values that will actually display properly in my Firefox
     browser on Unix or FreeBSD. These annoying characters include the
     Windows 1252 character set's "smart" quotes, trademark symbol, em
     dash, and other characters that don't display properly in non-Windows
     character sets. Previously, demoronization was done in the
     MiniRSSParser logic, but doing it in a plug-in makes more sense
     (especially since it can be used regardless of the underlying RSS
     parser).

  b) now escapes unknown character entities. This tactic is an attempt
     to deal with bad XML generated by broken feed generators. One place
     where unknown entities often appear is in links, where the link
     contains HTTP "GET" parameters, e.g.:

           http://rss.example.com/articles?id=100&mode=print

     The "&" in the URL causes XML parsing errors. The Common XML Fixups
     will convert the URL to:

           http://rss.example.com/articles?id=100&amp;mode=print

- curn's MiniRSSParser has been removed. There's no sense in maintaining a
  stripped-down RSS parser, when fully functional parsers such as Informa
  and ROME exist and are constantly being updated. curn now uses ROME by
  default (and ships with the necessary jars).

- curn's cache saving and loading logic has been refactored:

  a) It's now layered so that the default XML data store can be replaced
     with pretty much anything else (including, for instance, an RDBMS).
     To do that, a programmer must extend the (new) DataPersister class,
     implementing the appropriate methods, and then specify the 
     new data persister class via the "DataPersisterClass" configuration
     variable.

  b) Plug-ins can now save data to and read data from the curn cache (which
     is now formally called the "curn metadata repository"). A plug-in that
     wishes to persist data must implement the PersistentDataClient
     interface or extend the AbstractPersistentDataClient class. Plug-ins
     that do one of those two things are automatically polled for data to
     be written and invoke when their data is read.

- The PlugIn interface has changed:

  a) getName() is now getPlugInName().
  b) getSortKey() is now getPlugInSortKey().
  c) There's a new initPlutIn() method.

- curn now uses JDOM (http://www.jdom.org) to parse and write its cache
  (now called "feed metadata") XML file.

- Miscellaneous code cleanup based on output from PMD (pmd.sourceforge.net).

- The graphical installer now renders the license in a more readable,
  proportional font.

- Propagated modified license (from version 3.0) into source files.

- Updated bundled version of ASM from 2.2.1 to 2.2.3.


				 ---------
				 Bug Fixes
				 ---------

- Fixed global default handling logic in EmptyArticleSummaryPlugin class.
  Plug-in was parsing the global default setting, but not honoring it.

- Fixed an editing bug in the CommonsXMLFixups plug-in. The plug-in would
  convert the sequence "&amp;nbsp;" in the XML to "&amp;", leaving a stray
  "&" in the XML.

- ArticleFilterPlugIn was documented as supporting multiple "ArticleFilter"
  configuration items per feed, but the code only supported one. The code
  now supports multiple items, as indicated in the User's Guide.

- When I converted output handlers to FreeMarker, in version 2.6, I
  inadvertently dropped support for the global ShowRSSVersion configuration
  item. That support has been restored. The built-in HTML and text FreeMarker
  templates honor the configuration setting. See the User's Guide for details.

- Modified default Windows installation path from
  "%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\clapper.org\curn" to
  "%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\ClapperOrg\curn". The "." in "clapper.org"
  was causing problems on Windows 2000.

- Fixed Windows curn.bat file to quote arguments that might contains
  blanks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.0 (5 July, 2006)

			       ------------
			       Enhancements
			       ------------

- Added plug-in capability. Upon startup, curn will look for plug-ins
  in ${curn.home}/plugins, ${user.home}/curn/plugins and
  ${user.home}/.curn/plugins. (${user.home} is the Java System "user.home"
  property. ${curn.home} is the "curn" installation directory.)

  See the Users' Guide for details on writing and deploying plug-ins.

  NOTES: 

  1. For this capability to work properly, you must invoke curn via the
     supplied curn.sh shell script (Unix) or curn.bat (Windows) script.
     Those files handle setting ${curn.home} and running curn via a new
     Bootstrap class that finds all the plug-in jar files and installs an
     alternate class loader that will load classes from them.

  2. Custom OutputHandler classes should now be placed in ${curn.home}/lib,
     ${user.home}/curn/lib or ${user.home}/.curn/lib, so that curn can find
     them. Simply adding them to the CLASSPATH won't work any more.

- Converted some base curn functionality into (built-in) plug-ins.

- Path names in the curn configuration file can now be expressed with
  Unix-style file separators ("/" characters), regardless of the operating
  system where curn is being run. At runtime, curn will convert them to the
  appropriate file separator (e.g., "\" on Windows). This enhancement
  provides two benefits:

  1. It enhances the portability of curn configuration files.
  2. It provides a means to avoid using (and, therefore, having to escape)
     backslash characters in the configuration file.

- The "EditItemURL" feed configuration parameter may now be specified multiple
  times within a feed, provided each instance has its own unique suffix (e.g.,
  "EditItemURL1", "EditItemURL2", "EditItemURLFoo", etc.)

- curn now supports a per-feed "EditFeedURL" configuration parameter. Like
  "EditItemURL", this parameter may be be specified multiple times within a
  feed, provided each instance has its own unique suffix. "EditFeedURL" can
  be used to edit the feed's URL, as opposed to the URLs of the individual
  items within a feed.

- The "ShowDates" global configuration value (in the [curn]) section can
  now be overridden on a per-feed basis, by a feed-specific "ShowDates"
  configuration parameter.

- Added a new per-feed configuration item, "ArticleFilter", that permits
  filtering out feed items based on their content. See the User's Guide
  for details. (This capability is handled by a stock curn plug-in.)

- Added a new configuration item, "CommonXMLFixups". If enabled for a feed
  (or globally, for all feeds), curn will edit downloaded XML, before
  parsing it, to attempt to fix some of the more common XML syntax
  problems.

- curn's ScriptOutputHandler class now exports curn-related data to the
  script via a global "curn" object that does not have to be retrieved via
  bsf.lookupBean(). (i.e., The "curn" object is global to the script.) For
  backward compatibility with previously written scripts, the data is also
  available via the old beans, but new scripts should use the new "curn"
  script global.

- curn's full version string now contains a build ID string. The build ID
  now appears in the version stamp field in all default
  FreeMarkerOutputHandler templates.

- Enhanced error reporting (exception handling) in some areas.

				  -------
				  Changes
				  -------

- The org.clapper.curn.output.TextOutputHandler,
  org.clapper.curn.output.SimpleSummaryOutputHandler, and
  org.clapper.curn.output.html.HTMLOutputHandler classes are gone. They'd
  been deprecated as of version 2.6 and reimplemented in terms of the
  FreeMarkerOutputHandler. Use the FreeMarkerOutputHandler, instead.

- The global "GetGzippedFeeds" configuration parameter has been renamed to
  "GzipDownload". The old name is still accepted for now, but is
  deprecated, will generate a warning message, and may be removed in the
  future.

- The global "GzipDownload" parameter may now be overridden on a per-feed
  basis.

- The "SummaryOnly" configuration parameter is now deprecated. Please
  use the new "ReplaceEmptySummaryWith" configuration parameter. Use
  of the "SummaryOnly" parameter will result in a warning message, though
  it will still be honored. It will be removed entirely in a future
  release.

- curn no longer accepts email addresses on the command line. Instead,
  email addresses must be specified in the configuration file, using a new
  "MailOutputTo" configuration option in the main [curn] configuration
  section. This change was necessary to permit moving email handling into a
  plug-in. It's also more consistent, since the other email-related
  parameters (subject, SMTP host, sender) are specified in the
  configuration file.

- The following curn command line options are now deprecated. These command
  line options used to override the corresponding configuration items, but
  they no longer do that. They can still be specified on the command line,
  but their usage will generate warnings, and they will be ignored.

       SHORT OPTION   LONG OPTION        CORRESPONDING CONFIG ITEM
       ------------------------------------------------------------
       -a             --show-authors     ShowAuthors: true
       -A             --no-authors       ShowAuthors: false
       -d             --show-dates       ShowDates: true
       -D             --no-dates         ShowDates: false
       -r             --rss-version      ShowRSSVersion: true
       -R             --no-rss-version   ShowRSSVersion: false
       -T n           --threads n        MaxThreads: n
       -z             --gzip             GetGzippedFeeds: true
       -Z             --no-gzip          GetGzippedFeeds: false
       ------------------------------------------------------------

- curn no longer dumps the output of the first handler to standard output
  when not emailing output.

- Changed org.clapper.curn.ConfigFile to org.clapper.curn.CurnConfig.

- Completely removed support for old-style curn binary cache file. curn
  will no longer read and convert a pre-2.0 binary cache file.

- All classes extending org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSChannel must now provide
  a "removeItem()" method. This change only affects custom adapters for RSS
  parsers.

- The ScriptOutputHandler no longer unconditionally strips HTML from the
  parsed RSS feed data before passing it to the output script. Instead, it
  honors an "AllowEmbeddedHTML" output handler configuration item to permit
  embedded HTML ("true") or strip it ("false"). The configuration parameter
  defaults to "false", so existing configuration files with script-based
  output handlers will continue to behave the same.

- In the FreemarkerOutputHandler's template data model, the "showAuthor"
  and "showDate" items are deprecated, and are always set to "true". New
  ShowAuthorsPlugIn and ShowDatesPlugIn plug-in classes handle the
  "ShowAuthors" and "ShowDates" configuration items, respectively; those
  plug-ins remove the corresponding data from the parsed feeds if their
  respective flags are false, so the Freemarker "show" flags are no longer
  necessary (though you *should* check for empty "author" or "date" fields
  in your template).

- The CurnConfig class no longer supports the showDates() and showAuthors()
  methods.

				 ---------
				 Bug Fixes
				 ---------

- curn wasn't caching data about the overall feed (as opposed to the
  individual items in the feed, which were being cache). For download-only
  configurations, where the feeds are downloaded (and presumably saved),
  but not cached, this bug caused no cache to be saved, so the feeds were
  always downloaded on every run.

- The built-in MiniRSSParser wasn't handling relative URLs inside <link>
  elements (in any of the RSS formats).

- The built-in MiniRSSParser wasn't properly handling empty XML elements
  (e.g., "<author/>", "<dc:creator/>"). Some feeds have do them.

- curn now handles web servers that specify a feed's character set in an
  HTTP header that looks like this:

	Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"

  According to the HTTP/1.1 specification
  (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html), the "charset"
  field isn't supposed to be quoted. That is, a legal Content-Type header
  with a "charset" field should look like this:

	Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
	Content-Type: text/xml; charset=ISO-8859-1

  However, there are some broken HTTP servers (or servers with broken
  configurations) that insist on quoting the field.

- Various SaveAs parameters weren't properly being processed on Windows.
  Specifically, embedded file separators ("\" characters) were being swallowed
  when they should not have been. This bug fix actually occurred in the
  RollingFileWriter class (in the org.clapper.util library) that is bundled
  with curn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.4 (5 February, 2006)

- Fixed a bug reported by Manpreet Dharni <mpsdh2003 /at/ yahoo.com>: If
  the value for a TemplateFile configuration directive (to the
  FreeMarkerOutputHandler) contains white space (after variable expansion),
  curn complained that there were too many tokens. For instance:

      TemplateFile: url file:/C:/Program Files/clapper.org/curn/bin/html.ftl

  or

      # ${program:cwd.url} will expand to file:/C:/Program Files/...
      TemplateFile: url ${program:cwd.url}/html

  curn was parsing the value strictly on white space delimiters, so white
  space in a file name or URL caused curn to see too many tokens.

  curn now uses a new double-quoting capability in the
  org.clapper.util.config.Configuration class, allowing double quoting of
  tokens that may contain white space. Now, the above problem can be
  remedied by quoting the file name or URL:

      TemplateFile: url "${program:cwd.url}/html"
      TemplateFile: url "file:/C:/Program Files/clapper.org/curn/bin/html.ftl"

- Fixed sample script output handlers to use the correct methods for
  various curn API calls. I'd neglected to update them when I changed the
  API.

- Added a sample ObjectScript (http://objectscript.sourceforge.net/)
  script output handler.

  WARNING: This version of curn REQUIRES version 2.1.3 (or later) of the
  org.clapper.util Java Utility Library. If you install curn manually, be
  sure to download and install the updated org.clapper.util jar file, as well.
  (See http://software.clapper.org/java/util/) If you install curn via
  the graphical installer, the new version of the utility library will be
  installed automatically for you.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.3 (26 January, 2006)

- RFC822 parsing would fail if system locale wasn't US. Since RFC822 dates
  are specific to the US, RFC822 date formats are now wired to the US
  locale. Thanks to Tobias Kroha <t.kroha /at/ seto-gmbh /dot/ de> for the
  bug report and the suggested fix.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.2 (2 January, 2006)

- curn can now be installed (along with all dependent jars, documentation,
  sources, and a wrapper shell or BAT script) via a graphical installer.
  The graphical installer is based on the IzPack installer framework
  (http://www.izforge.com/izpack/).

- The Ant build.xml file wasn't properly constructing the source zip file.
  In particular, it was omitting properties files and FreeMarker template
  files.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.1 (13 December, 2005)

- In the default FreeMarker HTML template (used to generate HTML output):
  Added some non-breaking spaces after the channel name, to ensure visual
  separation from the first item.

- FreeMarkerOutputHandler class now uses the FreeMarker SimpleSequence and
  SimpleHash classes, instead of java.util.List and java.util.Map classes.
  (This change has no effect on output generation and is invisible to code
  outside the FreeMarkerOutputHandler.)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6 (25 November, 2005)

- Added new FreeMarkerOutputHandler, which uses the FreeMarker template
  engine (freemarker.sourceforge.net) to generate output based on
  template files. Three built-in templates are bundled with curn:

  - HTML      generates output identical to existing HTMLOutputHandler
  - Text      generates output identical to existing TextOutputHandler
  - Summary   generates output identical to existing SimpleSummaryOutputHandler

  The configuration directives for the FreeMarkerOutputHandler permit
  use of four kinds of templates:

  - Built-in templates (listed above)
  - Templates available via the class loader
  - Templates residing in a file on the computer where curn is running
  - Templates accessible via a URL

  Any one familiar with FreeMarker and with curn's FreeMarker data model
  can write a template and, thus, change curn's output without writing
  any code (other than the simple coding instructions in a FreeMarker
  template).

  See the "curn User's Guide" for details.

  The FreeMarkerOutputHandler class compiles unconditionally, so this
  version of curn requires the freemarker.jar file.

- The HTMLOutputHandler, TextOutputHandler and SummaryOutputHandler classes
  are now implemented in terms of the new FreeMarkerOutputHandler. This means
  the XMLC third-party jar is no longer necessary.

- The org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSChannel and org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSItem
  abstract classes have some new abstract methods, necessary to support the
  new clone() and makeCopy() methods. If you have written a custom RSS
  parser adapter for curn, you'll will have to change it to get it to
  compile with curn 2.6.

- Fixed a bizarre bug: If you configured a ScriptOutputHandler to run
  before the HTMLOutputHandler, and one of the feeds contained only HTML
  in the description (e.g., an image reference), the ScriptOutputHandler
  would strip the HTML from the channel--essentially removing the
  content--so that the HTMLOutputHandler wouldn't see the embedded HTML.
  The code now makes a copy of the feed data before stripping the HTML.

- Fixed NullPointerException in ROME parser adapter package's
  RSSItemAdapter class; the exception occurred when the item being
  processed had no summary data.

- Added a new "TotalCacheBackups" parameter, which allows you to keep
  any number of old caches around. If this parameter is greater than 0,
  then curn will roll the existing cache file over (much like a rolled-over
  log file) before overwriting it.

- Removed the "CacheBackup" parameter. Use the new "TotalCacheBackups"
  parameter instead.

- Added a "SavedBackups" parameter for all output handlers except the
  ScriptOutputHandler. If this parameter is greater than 0 for a given
  output handler (and if a "SaveAs" parameter is also specified), then the
  output handler will roll the "SaveAs" file over (much like a rolled-over
  log file) before overwriting it.

- The DaysToCache configuration parameter now accepts a special value of
  "NoLimit", indicating that the cache entries should never expire. The
  default value of the global DaysToCache configuration parameter is now
  365 days, not 30 days.

- Fixed bug: If a feed was marked as "SaveOnly", it was downloaded, but not
  parsed. But not parsing the file means the cache can't be updated properly.
  Now, downloaded files are parsed regardless, to ensure that the cache is
  properly maintained with RSS channel and item time stamps.

*** WARNING: This version of curn REQUIRES version 2.1 (or better) of
*** the org.clapper.util Java Utility Library. See
*** http://software.clapper.org/java/util/


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.1 (25 September, 2005)

- Fixed NullPointerException in TextOutputHandler, when channel has no URL.
- MiniRSSParser now handles Atom feeds that have unescaped, but
  well-formed, XHTML within a <content> element.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5 (19 August, 2005)

- ENHANCEMENT: The MiniRSSParser class now handles and stores multiple
  <link> elements in Atom feeds. The links are saved with URL, MIME type
  and link type (which can be one of "self" or "alternate", a subset of all
  the types supported by Atom). This allows output handlers to find the
  link that is most appropriate to their type. The HTMLOutputHandler class
  now searches for the "text/html" link and uses that, if it's present;
  if that's not present, it uses the first link marked with type "self".
  Currently, only the org.clapper.curn.parser.minirss.MiniRSSParser
  is capable of producing multiple links from an Atom feed.

  NOTE: This change affects the org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSItem and
  org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSChannel classes. Existing parser adapter
  layers must be changed, or they won't compile. (That's why this release
  is 2.5, not 2.4.1.)

- BUG FIX: Fixed to work with latest version of the ROME parser (0.6).
  (See http://rome.dev.java.net/)

  NOTE: This breaks support for some previous versions of ROME (e.g., 0.3).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4 (15 August, 2005)

- ENHANCEMENT: The HTMLOutputHandler
  (org.clapper.curn.output.html.HTMLOutputHandler) now supports a table of
  contents, which is useful when the number of feeds or items in the
  generated output is large. The generation of the table of contents is
  controlled by a new HTMLOutputHandler-specific configuration item,
  "TOCItemThreshold". That value defines the minimum number of feed items
  (across all feeds) that must be displayed before a table of contents is
  generated. The default value is a very large number, which effectively
  disables the table of contents completely.

  See the User's Guide for details.

- ENHANCEMENT: Expanded the forms of RFC-822 dates that the MiniRSSParser
  (org.clapper.curn.parser.minirss) class can handle.

- BUG FIX: MiniRSSParser (org.clapper.curn.parser.minirss) no longer aborts
  the parsing of an entire feed if an embedded URL (e.g., within a <link>
  element) is bad. That element is skipped, but processing of the feed
  continues. The error is logged.

- BUG FIX: Fixed problem with feeds that re-use item URLs. Previously, curn
  assumed that a feed always specified a new URL for a new item. If it
  found an item URL in its cache, curn would not display the item even if
  the item had new content (because it assumed that new content implied a
  new item URL). That broken assumption has been fixed. Now, when examining
  each item from an RSS feed, curn:

  a. First determines whether the item has a unique ID (e.g., a <guid>
     element in an RSS 2.0 feed, or an <id> element in an Atom feed). If
     the item has a unique ID, and that unique ID isn't in the cache, curn
     assumes that the item is new, and displays it.

  b. If the item has no ID, then curn attempts to find the item's URL in the
     cache. If the URL is not in the cache, then curn assumes the item is new,
     and displays it.

  c. If the item is in the cache, curn then extracts the (optional) item
     publication date from the item and the (optional) publication date
     from the cache entry. If both dates are present, curn compares them;
     if the item's publication date is newer than the publication date in
     the item's cache entry, curn assumes the item is new, and displays it.

  d. If all of the above tests fail (meaning the item is in the cache, but
     no additional information is available), then curn assumes that the item
     is old, and does not display it.

  Note: Prior to this fix, the curn cache did not keep an item's
  publication date. It does now. There is no need to update your cache,
  however; curn will adjust the cache automatically, over time, as items
  naturally age. The only exception is for feeds that are already
  misbehaving--e.g., feeds that have unique IDs per item and re-use the
  item URLs. For feeds like that, the simplest solution is to remove the
  feed's entry from the (XML) cache file and re-run curn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3 (10 August, 2005)

- curn now supports global and feed-specific "AllowEmbeddedHTML" configuration
  options. If set for a feed (or set globally and not overridden by the feed),
  the HTMLOutputHandler class will not strip any raw HTML it finds in the
  feed title, item title, item description, or item author fields; it will,
  instead, insert the raw HTML in the resulting HTML output. This is useful
  when handling feeds that have embedded images, for instance (like a comic
  site).

- Enhanced the MiniRSSParser Atom feed parser to account for the Atom 1.0
  specification. As part of this change:

  a) The org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSChannel interface has been converted to
     an abstract class.

  b) The org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSChannel and org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSItem
     classes now require new addAuthor(), clearAuthors(), and getAuthors()
     methods. The old getAuthor() and setAuthor() methods have been
     converted to concrete, final methods. These changes were necessary to
     support multiple authors per feed and per item. Existing callers of
     the old methods do not have to change, but existing curn parser
     adapters will have to change. (All parser adapters shipped with curn
     have been changed.)

NOTE: This version of curn REQUIRES version 2.0.2 of the org.clapper.util
library, since it uses some new methods in the
org.clapper.util.text.TextUtil class. It will NOT run with earlier versions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2.1 (09 Aug, 2005)

- curn's RSS date-parsing logic had a bug causing a NullPointerException
  if the date was empty or null. This could happen, for instance, in an
  RSS 1.0 feed with this construct:

	<dc:date></dc:date>

  That bug has been fixed. 

  Thanks to Tobias Kroha <tobias /at/ esce-neun /dot/ de> for finding the
  bug and suggesting the fix.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2 (29 July, 2005)

- curn's output handlers now support a "ShowCurnInfo" configuration
  parameter. If set to "true" (the default), then the output handlers write
  the curn version and other information to the generated output. If set to
  "false", the output handlers suppress that information. (Previously, the
  output handlers wrote that information unconditionally.)

  The "ShowCurnInfo" configuration parameter is actually parsed by the
  org.clapper.curn.output.FileOutputHandler abstract base class, so it is
  available to any subclass that wishes to query its status.

- curn no longer copies the generated output files to temporary files when
  emailing them. This buglet resulted from a combination of two things:

  a) The utility library (http://software.clapper.org/java/util/) has a
     set of email classes that provide a simplified front-end to the Java
     Mail API. The EmailMessage class supports adding attachments to and
     setting the text of a message from a java.io.File, a String or an
     java.io.InputStream. When using an InputStream, the EmailMessage class
     copies the contents to a temporary file. (It does this primarily
     because the Java Activation Framework's DataSource interface, which is
     used when specifying attachments, allows the caller to access the data
     source multiple times--and the JavaMail API appears to do that. One
     can't guarantee that an InputStream is rewindable, so the only
     solution, when presented with an InputStream attachment, is to copy
     the InputStream to a file.)

  b) The curn OutputHandler interface specifies a getGeneratedOutput()
     method that returned an InputStream, for flexibility (e.g., in case an
     output handler generates its content in memory). But the existing
     output handlers were all producing files anyway. So, the
     OutputHandler.getGeneratedOutput() method now returns a File, instead
     of an InputStream.

     NOTE: This change breaks existing output handlers! If you have a
     custom output handler that does not extend
     org.clapper.curn.output.FileOutputHandler, you'll have to change its
     getGeneratedOutput() method, or it won't compile.

NOTE: This version of curn REQUIRES version 2.0.1 of the org.clapper.util
library, since it uses some new methods in the
org.clapper.util.mail.EmailMessage class. It will NOT run with version 2.0.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.2 (08 July, 2005)

- curn was not honoring its "MailFrom" configuration option, so it was
  always computing the sender based on the current user name and host name.
  In some environments, using the default (computed) email address can
  cause problems when curn attempts to email its output (and, in any case,
  "curn" ought to honor one of its own documented configuration options).

  Thanks to "Moon Man" <yavinty /at/ yahoo.com> for emailing me about the
  problem.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.1 (07 July, 2005)

- On Windows, curn's supplied output handler classes (TextOutputHandler,
  HTMLOutputHandler) do not always produce output. Fix: Be sure to close
  the PrintWriter objects those classes use internally. The flush() method
  for all existing output handlers now ensure that they close their
  underlying streams, if any. The documentation for the OutputHandler class
  has been changed to indicate that the flush() method should also close
  any open streams.

  This bug does not appear to affect Unix Java VMs.

  Thanks to "Moon Man" <yavinty /at/ yahoo.com> for emailing me about the
  problem and the fix.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1 (11 May, 2005)

- The ShowAuthors configuration item can now be specified per-feed,
  as well as globally. The global value is the default.

- The HTML output now shows the author, if configured.

- The configuration file can now contain a "CacheBackup" directive that
  specifies the location of a cache backup. curn will copy the cache to
  the backup file before updating the cache on disk.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0 (22 April, 2005)

- Now requires Java 1.5.0 JDK/JRE.

- Various classes converted to use JDK 1.5 generics.

- MiniRSSParser now handles (and ignores) empty <link> elements in
  RSS version 0.92, RSS version 2.0, and Atom XML files.

- The cache file is now XML, instead of serialized Java objects. Using XML
  makes the code less sensitive to changes in the cache-related classes.
  curn will still load an old-style serialized Java cache file, but it will
  convert it to XML when it saves the cache.

- The "mimeType" object that the ScriptOutputHandler class publishes via
  the Bean Scripting Framework is now a java.io.StringWriter, instead of a
  java.io.StringBuffer. Use of a StringBuffer causes exceptions with BSF
  and the 1.5.0 JDK.

- The configuration file now supports an "env" pseudosection, to
  interpolate the values of environment variables into a configuration.
  (The 1.5 JDK has re-established support for environment variables.)
  See the User's Guide for details.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.12 (09 Aug, 2005) [MAINTENANCE RELEASE OF DEPRECATED CODE BRANCH]

- curn's RSS date-parsing logic had a bug causing a NullPointerException
  if the date was empty or null. This could happen, for instance, in an
  RSS 1.0 feed with this construct:

	<dc:date></dc:date>

  That bug has been fixed. 

  Thanks to Tobias Kroha <tobias /at/ esce-neun /dot/ de> for finding the
  bug and suggesting the fix.

- curn's output handlers now support a "ShowCurnInfo" configuration
  parameter. If set to "true" (the default), then the output handlers write
  the curn version and other information to the generated output. If set to
  "false", the output handlers suppress that information. (Previously, the
  output handlers wrote that information unconditionally.)

  The "ShowCurnInfo" configuration parameter is actually parsed by the
  org.clapper.curn.output.FileOutputHandler abstract base class, so it is
  available to any subclass that wishes to query its status.

- curn no longer copies the generated output files to temporary files when
  emailing them. This buglet resulted from a combination of two things:

     method that returned an InputStream, for flexibility (e.g., in case an
     output handler generates its content in memory). But the existing
     output handlers were all producing files anyway. So, the
     OutputHandler.getGeneratedOutput() method now returns a File, instead
     of an InputStream.

     NOTE: This change breaks existing output handlers! If you have a
     custom output handler that does not extend
     org.clapper.curn.output.FileOutputHandler, you'll have to change its
     getGeneratedOutput() method, or it won't compile.

NOTE: This version of curn REQUIRES version 1.1.9 of the org.clapper.util
library, since it uses some new methods in the
org.clapper.util.mail.EmailMessage class. It will NOT run with version 1.1.8.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.11 (08 July, 2005) [MAINTENANCE RELEASE OF DEPRECATED CODE BRANCH]

- curn was not honoring its "MailFrom" configuration option, so it was
  always computing the sender based on the current user name and host name.
  In some environments, using the default (computed) email address can
  cause problems when curn attempts to email its output (and, in any case,
  "curn" ought to honor one of its own documented configuration options).

- On Windows, curn's supplied output handler classes (TextOutputHandler,
  HTMLOutputHandler) do not always produce output. Fix: Be sure to close
  the PrintWriter objects those classes use internally. The flush() method
  for all existing output handlers now ensure that they close their
  underlying streams, if any. The documentation for the OutputHandler class
  has been changed to indicate that the flush() method should also close
  any open streams.

  This bug does not appear to affect Unix Java VMs.

  Thanks to "Moon Man" <yavinty /at/ yahoo.com> for emailing me about the
  problem and the fix.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.9 (21 April, 2005)

- The "mimeType" object that the ScriptOutputHandler class publishes via
  the Bean Scripting Framework is now a java.io.StringWriter, instead of a
  java.io.StringBuffer. Use of a StringBuffer causes exceptions with BSF
  and the 1.5.0 JDK.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.8 (08 April, 2005)

- MiniRSSParser now handles (and ignores) empty <link> elements in
  RSS version 0.92, RSS version 2.0, and Atom XML files.
- When run in single-threaded mode (i.e., MaxThreads set to 1 in the
  configuration file), an exception that occurs while processing one
  feed doesn't abort the whole run.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.7 (09 February, 2005)

- Substitution expressions (e.g., in the PreparseEdit or EditItemURL
  configuration items) now properly properly handle substitutions of the empty
  string. Strings like this were previously rejected as syntactically
  incorrect:

      s/foo//

  They are now permitted and processed properly.

- build.xml no longer hard-codes jikes compiler. To use jikes, either
  pass 

      -Dbuild.compiler=jikes 

  to ant, or put that option in ANT_OPTS in your personal ant startup file
  ($HOME/.antrc on Unix, or %HOME%\antrc_pre.bat on Windows).

- build.xml corrected so it no longer unconditionally recompiles everything.

- Serializable classes now provide their own serialVersionUID variable, per
  recommendations in the JDK 1.5 java.io.Serializable docs and in jikes
  1.22 warnings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.6 (02 December, 2004)

- Added new MaxSummarySize configuration parameter. If a summary exceeds
  the specified size, it is truncated. See the User's Guide and the sample
  configuration file for details.

- Abstract org.clapper.curn.parser.RSSItem class now contains a
  getSummaryForDisplay() utility method, which handles stripping HTML tags,
  optionally using the description if the summary is not defined,
  and applying the MaxSummarySize constraint (if applicable). Modified
  existing output handlers to use this new method.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.5 (10 November, 2004)

- NOTE: You MUST have version 1.1.4 (or better) of the org.clapper.util
  library, or this version of curn WILL NOT WORK!

- Added "UserAgent" configuration parameter in the [curn] section and the
  individual feed sections. See the sample configuration or the User's
  Guide for details.

- Added "SaveAsEncoding" configuration parameter to individual feed
  sections. Allows specification of encoding for output file. Encoding can
  later be used via the ForceEncoding parameter for an instance of curn
  that reads a saved file. See the sample configuration or the User's Guide
  for details.

- The "ForceCharacterEncoding" per-feed configuration parameter is now
  called "ForceEncoding" (though "ForceCharacterEncoding" is recognized,
  as well, for backward compatibility).

- For "file:" URLs, unless "ForceEncoding" is specified, the default encoding
  is now "utf-8", instead of the Java VM's default. This plays better with
  the new "SaveAsEncoding" parameter.

- curn now gives email attachments names with reasonable extensions.
  Previously, default names (ending in ".tmp") were used, which gave some 
  mail clients (e.g., some versions of Outlook) fits.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.4 (20 October, 2004)

- In the org.clapper.util API, org.clapper.util.misc.Logger is now in the
  org.clapper.util.logging package and is now uses the java.util.logging
  API directly, instead of using Jakarta Commons Logging. This eliminates
  another third-party library dependency, but required modifications
  various "import" statement in curn classes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.3 (16 October, 2004)

- curn now sets an appropriate "User-Agent" HTTP header on HTTP requests,
  instead of defaulting to whatever the Java VM uses.

- An exception thrown while processing a feed now contains the feed URL
  in its exception message. This is especially useful for emailed log
  exceptions.

- Where possible, exception messages are now stored in properties files and
  accessed via ResourceBundle objects, allowing for localization.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.2 (12 October, 2004)

- Simplified loading of API version, in build.xml. Instead of loading
  version from Version.class, it now loads the version from a properties
  file. The Version class uses the same properties file, as a resource
  bundle.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.1 (10 October, 2004)

- Fixed bug with PreparseEdit per-feed configuration directive (introduced
  in version 1.5). Multiple edit commands would cause duplication of lines
  in feeds XML file.

- If there are no output handlers defined, feeds are not run through the
  XML parser (since there's no point). This was already supposed to be
  happening, but there was this small bug...

- Added "SaveOnly" configuration option to Feed sections. See User's Guide
  or sample config for details.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5 (07 October, 2004)

- Now requires JDK 1.4 or better. JDK 1.3 is no longer supported. Among
  the reasons for this requirement:

  * I wanted to use the new assertion capabilities of 1.4

  * The regular expression classes that come with 1.4 are more extensible
    than the Jakarta ORO classes, in that they work with anything that
    implements the CharSequence interface, not just with Strings. Plus,
    using java.util.regexp, instead of Jakarta ORO, removes a third-party
    library dependency.

- Added new PreparseEdit configuration file entry, supported in the Feed
  section. Permits applying perl-like s/// edits to the downloaded XML file
  before it is parsed. Useful for feeds that serve XML files that don't
  parse properly. (One site I read insists on serving a channel that
  contains unescaped "&" characters in the text.) See the User's Guide
  and the sample configuration for details on this new configuration
  parameter.

- Converted code that used Jakarta ORO to use the JDK 1.4 java.util.regexp
  classes.

- Overhauled build.xml to make compilations more efficient. Requires a
  newer version of Jikes (if compiling with Jikes).

- Cleaned up a lot of unnecessary imports. Addressed minor issues that
  Jikes warned about.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.1 (28 September, 2004):

- Added ForceCharacterEncoding (per-feed) configuration parameter. If
  specified, curn will use the supplied character encoding when parsing
  the feed's XML, instead of the server-supplied or document-supplied
  encoding. This is useful in the following cases:

  * the remote HTTP server doesn't supply an HTTP Content-Encoding header, 
    and the local (Java) default encoding doesn't match the document's 
    encoding
  * the remote HTTP server supplies the wrong encoding

  See the Users Guide or the sample configuration file for more information.

- Added HTMLEncoding parameter to the configuration for the HTMLOutputHandler
  (org.clapper.curn.output.html.HTMLOutputHandler) class. This parameter
  sets the desired character set encoding of the generated HTML file.
  The encoding is set in a <META> tag in the document, and it is used when
  opening the output file (to ensure proper translation of characters from
  the in-memory Unicode character set). If not set, it defaults to "utf-8".


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4 (22 September, 2004):

- All output handlers have been moved under "org.clapper.output". It
  is (regrettably) necessary to update curn configuration files that
  reference the old fully-qualified class names.

  Handler class               Old Package             New Package
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  HTMLOutputHandler           org.clapper.htmloutput  org.clapper.output.html
  SimpleSummaryOutputHandler  org.clapper.curn        org.clapper.curn.output
  TextOutputHandler           org.clapper.curn        org.clapper.curn.output
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- curn now supports multiple output handlers of the same class in the same
  configuration file.

- curn now comes bundled with a new ScriptOutputHandler 
  (org.clapper.output.script.ScriptOutputHandler). This handler requires the
  Apache Jakarta Bean Scripting Framework (BSF), available at
  "http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/". It's basically a shim that uses BSF
  to permit output handlers to be written in any BSF-supported scripting
  language (e.g., Jython, JRuby, Rhino Javascript, etc.)

- The "Quiet" configuration option is no longer supported. If it appears
  in a configuration file, it will be silently ignored. Similarly, the
  --quiet (-q) and --no-quiet (-Q) command line options no longer exist.

- (API) When parsed from the config, output handlers are now wrapped in
  ConfiguredOutputHandler objects, which contain all the config data for
  the handler, and provide a means to instantiate a handler easily.

- (API) The ConfigFile class no longer supports the Quiet configuration
  option, and the methods used to test for the value of that option have
  been removed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3.3 (16 September, 2004):

- Fixed slight problem when translating embedded newlines into spaces in
  parsed XML character data.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3.2 (15 September, 2004):

- Now handles feeds with alternate character sets (e.g., UTF-8) better.
  Note that there's still the possibility of information loss if a feed
  with an alternate character set such as UTF-8 is saved to a local file,
  and the local file is then parsed by curn. That's because curn currently
  doesn't have a way to save the original character set, so it converts the
  feed to the Java VM's native character set before saving it to the local
  file.

- Added adapter classes for the Rome RSS parser. (See
  https://rome.dev.java.net/). Test with Rome 0.3. Rome supports all the
  current RSS feed types.

  NOTE: Rome requires version 1.0 of JDOM (http://www.jdom.org/)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3.1 (13 September, 2004):

- HTMLOutputHandler now displays channel link properly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3 (09 September, 2004):

- Fixed some caching bugs and problems. First, cache lookups are now
  consistent. Second, the cache now supports lookups by item ID and item
  URL, not just ID, and curn will check for the URL if the item isn't
  cached by ID. (Some RSS feeds provide a unique ID for each item. Some
  don't.) This change fixes caching for (broken) RSS feeds that provide
  different IDs for the same URL. I've seen at least one site where the
  ID for a given item changes daily, even though the item and its link do
  not.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2 (28 August, 2004):

- First version of curn posted to the web.
